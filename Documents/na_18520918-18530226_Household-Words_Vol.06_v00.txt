  that had been used for all the little lords and    she was called in those days, Miss Grace, for
   ladies long ago, with a. pleasant <U+FB01>re burning     she was the younger sister. Such a beauty
   in the grate, and the kettle boiling on the hob,  she must have been l but with such a set,
   and tea things spread out on the table ; and      proud look, and such scorn looking out of her
   out of that room was the night-nursery, with      handsome eyes, with her eyebrows ust a little
   a. little crib for Miss Rosamond close to my      raised, as if she wondered how any one could

   wife, to bid us welcome ; and both he and         her lip curled at us, as we stood there gazing.
   she were so hospitable and kind, that by-and      She had a dress on, the like of which I had
   by Miss Rosamond and me felt u-ite at home ;      never seen before, but it was all the fashion
   and by the time tea was over, s e was sitting     when she was young ; a hat of some soft
   on Dorothy’s knee, and chattering away as fast    white stuff like beaver, pulled a. little over
   as her little tongue could go. I soon found       her brows, and a beautiful plume of feathers
   out that Dorothy was from Westmoreland,           sweeping round it on one side; and her gown
   and that bound her and me together, as it         of .blue satin was open in front to a quilted
i were ; and I would never wish to meet with         white stomacher.

its face towards the wall, and was not Bessy; but one day when I was in the ball

    How oft in those vast solitudes             While we would stop our talk, to hear
    A friend is sooner found than here !        The distant rushing of the deer,
    It was a youth of noble blood               The sound of falling water near ;
    Who chose, in his romantic mood.            And Leena, happy as a child,
       In hunter's hat to dwell ;               Brought for us from her native wild
    A gifted youth of bearing high,                The gatherings of her heart :
    A free, proud step, a glancing eye—         Soft gushes of melodious thought
       His name was Claude d'Estrelle.          Deep poetry within her wrought,
    His heart had found him one who made           By living long apart.
    Those solitary places glad;                While Claude’s bright smiles fell fond and fast
    A hunter's orphan—left, while young,        Upon his dear enthusiast,
    Her Indian mother‘s tribe among—           And, all untrained, he loved to <U+FB01>nd
    Who saw him dying on the waste,            Those blossoms of the uncultured mind,
    And on her fearless bosom placed           And thought not how the world might try
    His fevered head, and touched his brow         The spirit of his untaught wife,
    With hands as cool and soft as snow ;      Though all who looked on Leena’s eye
    And when, at his <U+FB01>rst conscious waking,    Might feel some destined agony
       He saw his guardian of the woods,           Lay folded in her life.
    In whose dark eye a hope was breaking      Such a high power of deathless love
       Like moonlight over dusky <U+FB02>oods,        Did in its depths unfathomed move;
    While tears of mingled joy and doubt       It seemed for special trials given,
       Down from the heavy lashes ran,         The boon of a foreseeing Heaven.
   As though her heart was <U+FB02>owing out
       In pity for the lonely man—
                                               That time of trial came at last,
    His mov’d soul vowed that maiden brave

    Should own the life she tried to save.         And I had wandered wide.
    So Leena, ere that summer <U+FB02>ed,
                                               A second time Claude laid to rest
    The noble Claude d'Estrelle had wed.       His sick head on that faithful breast ;
                                                   So rested till he died.
    On one of those red autumn eves—           Then she unto his brother went,
       Tbat gorgeous time of forest life—      With those his dying breath had sent—
   Amid its wealth of changing leaves          Her children twain, a welcome prize—
       I <U+FB01>rst beheld my friend’s young wife.       The last of that proud race.
    We met upon an open glade,                 But there were none but scornful eyes
    Whence lines of brown and purple shade     For her woe-printed face;
    Their long, soft swelling vistas made      And back he harshly bade her go,
       Up to the evening sky.                  That those she bore might yet outgrow
   And, while we gazed, some dim arcade            The sense of her disgrace.

   And gleaming orange grove o’er grove        How could she let the mother die
    Seem vying with the clouds above:             In such a loving heart?
   While crimson foliage, here and there,      But, with an uncomplaining eye,
   Would deepen in the amber air,                  (Despair had taught her art,)
   And drops of glory fall between             She begged a little while to stay,
   On many a glistening evergreen;            And stole them in the night away,
   The waterfall to jewels turned,                And hid them in the wood;
   The lake like one great ruby burned         Seven days and nights, was sorely pressed,
      Upon the wood’s green breast;            And then, beside her ri<U+FB02>ed nest,
   And all that 'wildering splendour seemed       A childless mother stood !
   As still as something we had dreamed ;      But when her love’s strong crying still
   The leaf's light <U+FB02>utter to the ground      Did too much chafe the iron will,
   Became a noticeable sound,                  He gave her, with an ample bribe,
      So silent was its rest !                 Unto a stranger Indian tribe
   And Leena's <U+FB01>gure, lithe and tall,             A slave oppressed to be ;
      Against the glowing background stood 1— For there her white blood was her shame ;
   Well might her husband ask if all          But woman's heart, whate'er her name,
   The dames that tread in courtly hall       Indian, or English, is the same—
      Could match his lady of the wood ;          A mother set her free.
   There, wearing for her coronet             She tracked them to a distant state
   Her own rich bands of wavy jet ;               By many a wild and dangerous way,
      Soft as the fawn’s her eye,             And prayed the tyrant of her fate
   A colour on the clear brown cheek              That she, among his slaves, might stay
   Like evening‘s last faint crimson streak   Near her beloved ones, though she bore
      Upon the twilight sky.                  A mother's precious name no more.
   Long, pleasant nights with Claude I passed He su<U+FB02>‘ered her to take her part
   In his rude dwelling on the waste,            Upon the slave’s tear-watered soil ;
      Beside the <U+FB01>re of pine :                So little knew the mother's heart,
   While Leena’s graceful tenderness
   Wreathed round him like the light caress
      Of her own forest vine ;
                                                 He thought to tire it out by toil.
                                              But, stronger than the strong man‘s will,
                                              Her children’s love would own her still.

      So secretly he sent her where                    Sure she has but to prove her claim !
      ’Neath Afric’s hot unwholesome air              She knows not yet the mother's name.
         A wild plantation lay ;                       She clasped her knees, to melt her pride
      A fearful place of toil and tears,              With Love’s pathetic questions tried,
      Where, how she lived for twenty years,          Pausing between them to espy
         Sure only God might say.                      Some little softening in the eye.
       To cheer her lonely banishment                 Had she not seen the eyes before her
      A dream of Claude He nightly sent,              At childish wakings bending o’er her ?
      And of the little children too;                 Had not these hands her baby head
      (For in her heart they never grew).             With forest blossoms often spread ?
      Oh, what sick thoughts were out her prime!      And then that tune—her father's tune l
      The long, long wasting of the time!             How it had been her nightly boon,
      The dark hair changed, the eyesight dim         To hear it as she sank to rest?
         Had spent itself in tears ;
      But still her <U+FB01>rm and patient hope              An impulse moved the loving breast;
      Grew stronger as each slender prop              That tune. "T was but a lullaby;
         Fell from it with the years;                 But she to turn the air would try,
     And o’er her love, time harmless <U+FB02>ed;            And nature‘s sleeping sympathies
     Absence but nursed it, tears but shed            Beneath the sweet old notes might rise.
     A rainbow glory on its head ;                    ’T was a quaint fancy as might be,
     And hardship, pain, and cruelty,                 And born of love's credulity;
     Proved it, to <U+FB01>nd it could not die.              That song—oh, how it trembled up!
     Her life did but one thought contain—               It almost seemed a sighing—
      To see her children once again.                  The farewell of departing Hope
      For twenty years she strove, and then              While Joy and Love lay dying.
         At last she reached the shore ;              A common tune it scarce could be;
     Heaven put it in a sailor's heart                   The heart had set the homely words
     To let her in his ship depart,                   To an impassioned melody
         And seek her lost, once more.                   That swept from its excited chords ;
                                                      That, and the face so grave and mesh,
      She reached home with the closing year;         The wistful eye, the changing cheek,
     0h, had they died, those children dear?             Made such a touching spell,
      Had they forgotten? No! not her!                The longing hand was fondly laid
      To them she begged her way along;               Upon her daughter's haughty head,
      Her earnest purpose made her strong ;              And there she let it dwell.
      Some careless strangers gave her our            Yea, Childhood's love seemed springing there.
      News that it burned and thrilled to hear;       But, hush ! a step upon the stair
      How, when years past, her old foe died,            That daughter loveth well.
     Another childless brother tried                  And he, she knows his title high
      To bring her children to his side ;             Would ne’er to Indian blood ally,
     And how her son right gladly went                Her pride, her love, are all at stake ;
     Into his forest settlement.                      She strives the kindly spell to break :
      Some said he lived a hunter wild,               Tells Leena, with some natural pain,
     And some that he had died a child.               That they must never meet again ;
      Then of her daughter ;—she had stayed           And offers—insult strange and cold—
         The treasure of her wealthy home,            To buy her secrecy with gold.
      And grown so beautiful, they said.
         Enough ! For nought she has not come.        The mother <U+FB02>ed, as one afraid,
      The high heart throbs, the dark eyes <U+FB01>ll;       Two days and nights : and never stayed
      Then one at least is living still !                Her hot and panting feet.
                                                      It was the time of festival,
      Anon, beside a lady fair                        And doors and hearts were open all,
         Stood Leena in a splendid room ;                And friend with friend did greet.
      Gazed on the curls of auburn hair,              The light and warmth around her glowed,
         The lustrous eyes, the <U+FB02>ushing bloom,        While hers was still the frozen road—
      With half a sigh to think how wild                 An emblem of her fate.
      Her fancy, that a little child                  And yet the broad, unsleeping eye
         Might meet her at the door,                  That guides the sparrows in the sky,
      That might be potted and caressed,                 Did on her footsteps wait.
      And nestle in its mother’s breast,
         As in the days of yore.                      She sank beneath an oak tree bare,
      And yet 'twas with a joyful thrill              On the third night, she knew not where.
      Of pride she saw her beauty still.              The pure snow seemed the only thing
      “ Leena ! " She does not turn as though         To her sick heart‘s imagining
      It was her name. Poor mother, no i              That had not changed ; and she would lie
      Alas for thee ! that cold surprise,             Upon its quiet breast, and die.
          So unbelieving, so unmoved—
      How can she, with her father’s eyes,            A little further, sinking heart!
         Look strangely on the face he loved?            To the next turning only press;
      The little dream-child she hath lost—           ’Tis hard that thou should'st die; thou art
         And yet may no new daughter <U+FB01>nd '2              But one stone’s throw from happiness !
      It cannot be; she hath a host                   Hush ! rising on the frosty air,
          Of memories to wake her mind.                  It is a Christmas hymn l

36                A ROUND OF STORIES BY THE CHRISTMAS FIRE.
     The kindly sounds have reached her there ;                           But oh, that quiet, joyful night,
        Have roused a feeling dim,                                           While Claude and his fair girlish wife
     Amid the lonesomeness of death,                                      Moved round her with such proud delight;
     That some one, on a prayerful breath,                                   Now stopped to weep at her past life,
        Her passing soul might hear ;                                     Now gently chafed the blistered feet,
     Perhaps through her exhausted frame                                  Anon between them moved her seat ;
     Some strong, mysterious impulse came                                 Now, as they sat, the way-worn brow
        From Him who brought her there.                                       Was pressed against the golden hair
     And, in its strength, she dragged her feet                           Or to the blooming cheek ; and now
     Bound to a straggling village street,                                   Claude’s glowing lips were meeting there.
        And reached a house of prayer.                                    Of Christmas hearths there never shone
     She saw not how red men and white,                                   A brighter, dearer, happier one.
     (The sudden glow, the glare of light,
        Those heavy eyes made blind),                                     I heard this story when I came—
     Were stirring, ’neath the breath intense                                 In part from Claude, in part from one
     Of one young preacher’s eloquence                                    Who called upon her mother’s name
        Like corn before the wind.                                        With deep remorse and burning shame,
     At last the listless ear was met                                        When friend and hireling all were gone,
        By one consoling word :                                           And he, who but her gold had wed,
     “ A mother; yea, she may forget:                                     Approached not her infected bed.
        I will not, saith the Lord."                                      Oh, for that one kind face that she
     And, from the preacher’s lips there sprung                               So harshly drove away!
     The grand poetic Indian tongue,                                      That sad, heart-breaking melody
     The while his reaching fancy strove                                      Did haunt her while she lay.
     To paint that holiest earthly love-—                                 I went for Leena, and she came—
     A mother’s; and he told a tale                                       (Hers the true love that does not blame,
     So like her own it made her veil                                         That “suffers and is kind")—                         ‘
     Her eyes, lest, with a look at him,                                  Touched the parched lips, and knew no fear,
     She might dispel a blissful dream.                                   Though Death was kissing them with her;

     A wild hope, with it, rose and sank,                                 The dew of her forgiving love,                         ,
     And thus unto an end he drew:                                        Till there Heaven‘s olive branch and dove
     “Her fate, oh, would to God I knew !                                     A resting-place did <U+FB01>nd.

     Here pining, or at peace above,                                      And Leena would not that she died
        Hath not forgotten Claude d’Estrelle ! "                          With her last wish ungrati<U+FB01>ed ;
     She made no cry, she heard the name;                                  So—trembling, through that silent room,
        A little lower sank her head :                                    Amid Death's deeply gathering gloom—
     A gentle pause of being came,                                         Sang with calm lips her fav'rite strain,
        And well it did, or life had <U+FB02>ed.                                 But with a heavy heart again :
     No other words, nor prayer, nor hymn,                                Full well we knew the closing ear
        Nor gathering feet the long trance broke,                             Would lose it all too soon;
     Till, with each sense confused and dim,                              That she, as its last notes drew near,
        At last upon his arm she woke,                                        Was dying with the tune.
     And saw compassion soft and warm                                     And when the lullaby had ceased,
        Rain o'er her from his full dark eye,                             We saw she had been sung to rest.
     And felt as one beneath a charm,
         Content for ever thus to lie :                                   Leena and I met once again.
     Her heart so weak with the excess                                    A pleasant evening, after rain
      Of its unspoken happiness.                                          And storm, her latter life hath been;
     Yet, from her lips his own words fell—                               I watched her bend her eyes serene
     “ Hath not forgotten Claude d’Estrelle."                                 Upon the Book of Life,
     And then her shaking hand did seek                                   And asked myself could they have seen
      To part his hair, to touch his cheek ;                                  So much of pain and strife?
      The voice, the touch, the loving eyes,                              And children’s children unto her
   . Did link up broken memories                                          As loving little teachers were;
         That could not be withstood;                                     A very presence from above,
     His life with Nature and with Heaven                                  That simple woman's faith and love.
      To him had quick perceptions given :
         His heart was at the <U+FB02>ood;
     It moved him on, he could not speak,
     But, with strong weeping clasped her neck.                        THE CHRISTMAS NUMBERS
     And sobbing women, at the scene,                                      OF HOUSEHOLD~'"WORD’S
